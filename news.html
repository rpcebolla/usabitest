    <div class="newsdiv" id="new1">
        <h2>Good news, everyone!</h2>
        
        <p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? And why did 'I' have to take a cab? In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
        
        <p>Large bet on myself in round one. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>

        <p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</p>

    <div class="newsdiv" id="new2">
        <h2>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</h2>

        <p>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>
            
        <p>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</p>
            
        <p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
            
        <p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. Do a flip! With gusto. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</p>
